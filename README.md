# guessMyNumber
5th project.

So I had to manually deploy my site for some reason it just refused to load from my github.
I even tried to to redeploy it a couple times.
I feel pretty confident with this project, and how it came out.
Everytime we do these big projects I feel more and more confident with the stuff we cover in class.
please don't hesitate to let me know where my coding needs improvment!

thank you for all you guys do!
