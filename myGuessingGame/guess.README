I feel pretty confindent with this project, but am definetly ready to hear critisim on the code I used.
That felt like it was easy, but I feel like my code is a little depedent on if statments and a liitle heavy on variables.
But please do let me know if that is wrong. I made sure to go through and try to iron out as many bugs as I could, but may have missed one or two.
also let me know if you run into any. 

Thank you for everything you guys do, I know you are working hard and I feel like I'm learning so much every week!
